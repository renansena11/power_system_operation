# power_system_operation

Implemented in MATLAB.

This work was developed aiming to carry out the operation of 3 power generation plants.

As loads vary in the system, frequencies, voltages and other variables change, and it is necessary to compensate for these with regulators and compensators.

In this work, the simulation of load variations and compensations in generating plants is carried out.

Three generating plants and the interconnection between them and the loads are modeled.
